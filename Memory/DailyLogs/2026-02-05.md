## UI/UX Updates (Enterprise + Compact)
- Compact pass: reduced dashboard padding/gaps, chart heights, alert row height; tighter KPI cards.
- Enterprise styling: updated design tokens (palette, borders, radii, shadows) for more “corporate” look.
- Earnings Overview:
  - Replaced chip-style breakdown with grouped tables (Gender/Ethnicity/Employment Type).
  - Added insights: Top Growth Dept + Biggest Decline Dept.
  - Added Top Departments (Current) list.
  - Added YoY Movers with tabs (Declines / Smallest Growth) and empty-state messaging.
  - Fixed spacing gap with Alerts by stretching row alignment.
- Time-off Overview:
  - Rebalanced layout (donut + details), added details panel styling.
  - Added insights bar: Largest Segment + Gap vs #2 (shows <0.1% with #2 name and days).
  - Set minimum content height to reduce small gaps.
- Alerts panel:
  - Enterprise styling refinements (borders, badges, dashed row dividers).
  - Auto-fit grid; last card spans full-width when odd count to remove empty gap.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed EarningsChart style block placement (JSX parse error).
  - Added missing React hook import (useMemo).

## Notes
- Changes are UI-only; no backend logic or API schema changes.
